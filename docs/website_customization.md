# PyCommerce Website Customization System

## Overview

The PyCommerce Website Customization System provides store owners with an intuitive, flexible way to design and customize their storefronts. This document outlines the architecture, components, and implementation plan for creating a complete website builder experience within the PyCommerce platform.

## Core Components

### 1. Template Management

- **Base Templates**: A collection of professionally designed store templates serving as starting points
- **Theme Inheritance**: Ability to extend and customize base templates without modifying original files
- **Template Version Control**: Track changes and allow reverting to previous versions

### 2. Visual Page Builder

- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Create and modify page layouts without coding
- **Section Management**: Pre-built sections for common store components (hero, featured products, etc.)
- **Responsive Design Controls**: Preview and adjust layouts for different screen sizes
- **Element Library**: Collection of UI components (buttons, cards, image galleries, etc.)

### 3. Content Management

- **WYSIWYG Editor Integration**: Rich text editing with formatting controls
- **Media Library Integration**: Seamless access to the existing media management system
- **Content Blocks**: Reusable content fragments that can be placed on multiple pages
- **Dynamic Content**: Display content based on customer behavior, time, or other variables

### 4. Theme Settings

- **Global Style Controls**: Configure colors, typography, spacing, and other design elements
- **CSS Variables**: Define a consistent design system across the store
- **Layout Options**: Control headers, footers, sidebars, and page width
- **Advanced Custom CSS**: Provide access for custom CSS input when needed

### 5. Plugin Integration

- **Extension Points**: Well-defined areas where plugins can add UI components
- **Widget System**: Allow plugins to register widgets for placement in designated areas
- **Template Hooks**: Enable plugins to inject content or functionality at specific template locations
- **API for Theme Interaction**: Allow plugins to react to theme changes or adapt their appearance

## Technical Architecture

### Data Model

- **Template**: Base structure defining page layouts and sections
- **Theme**: Collection of customizations applied to a template
- **Page**: Individual pages with content and layout settings
- **Section**: Reusable layout components within pages
- **Block**: Content or functional elements placed within sections

### Storage Strategy

- **Database Storage**: Store structure, content, and configuration in the database
- **Rendered Cache**: Generate and cache compiled CSS/HTML for performance
- **Asset Management**: Efficient storage and delivery of theme assets

### Rendering Pipeline

1. **Request Handling**: Identify tenant and requested page/content
2. **Theme Resolution**: Determine active theme and template
3. **Content Compilation**: Assemble page components and inject dynamic content
4. **Rendering**: Generate HTML/CSS with theme customizations applied
5. **Caching**: Store rendered output for improved performance

## User Interface Components

### Admin Interface

- **Theme Marketplace/Gallery**: Browse and install pre-built themes
- **Theme Customizer**: Visual interface for adjusting theme settings
- **Page Editor**: WYSIWYG interface for creating and editing pages
- **Layout Manager**: Configure site structure and navigation
- **Preview Mode**: View changes before publishing

### Editor Capabilities

- **Rich Text Editing**: Format text, add links, embed media
- **Media Selection**: Browse and insert images/videos from the media library
- **Element Properties**: Configure appearance and behavior of page elements
- **Revision History**: Track and revert changes when needed
- **Responsive Preview**: Test appearance on different devices

## Integration with Existing PyCommerce Systems

### Media Manager Integration

- Leverage the existing media management system for image storage and retrieval
- Extend the media browser component to work within the page editor context
- Add image optimization and responsive image handling

### Multi-Tenant Support

- Ensure complete isolation of theme assets and settings between tenants
- Enable theme sharing capabilities across tenant groups when appropriate
- Support theme export/import between tenants

### Plugin System Extension

- Extend the current plugin architecture to support UI component registration
- Create standardized ways for plugins to inject content into themes
- Provide theme-aware styling capabilities to plugin developers

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

- Implement theme settings storage and retrieval (extending current capabilities)
- Create basic theme customizer for global settings (colors, fonts, etc.)
- Develop template inheritance system for theme overrides
- Build CSS variable generation from theme settings

### Phase 2: Content Editing

- Integrate enhanced WYSIWYG editor with media library access
- Implement content blocks and reusable components
- Create basic page structure editor (add/remove/rearrange sections)
- Build preview system for theme and content changes

### Phase 3: Visual Builder

- Develop drag-and-drop interface for page building
- Implement responsive design controls
- Create element library with configurable components
- Build advanced layout management tools

### Phase 4: Extensions and Optimization

- Implement plugin integration points for UI extension
- Create widget system for theme areas
- Develop performance optimizations (caching, lazy loading)
- Build import/export capabilities for themes and layouts

## Security Considerations

- **XSS Prevention**: Sanitize all user-generated content and CSS
- **Permission Management**: Define granular permissions for theme editing
- **Resource Limits**: Prevent excessive resource usage by custom code
- **Validation**: Ensure theme components meet quality and compatibility standards

## Future Expansion

- **Template Marketplace**: Allow designers to create and sell custom themes
- **AI-Assisted Design**: Implement AI tools for generating theme variations
- **A/B Testing**: Test different theme elements for conversion optimization
- **Customer Personalization**: Allow per-customer theme adjustments
