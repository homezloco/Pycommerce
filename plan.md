## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Backend**: Python 3.11+, FastAPI (APIs), Flask (Admin UI)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5, Jinja2 templates, JavaScript ES6+
- **AI**: OpenAI, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, OpenRouter integration
- **Payments**: Stripe, PayPal with encrypted credential storage
- **Document Generation**: WeasyPrint for PDF export

### Deployment Strategy
- **Platform**: Replit for development and deployment
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem with S3-compatible fallback
- **Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and logging

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] Zero server restart errors during normal operation
- [ ] All database operations complete within 500ms
- [ ] 100% template rendering without errors
- [ ] Complete API documentation with examples
- [ ] Automated test coverage > 80%

### Phase 2 Success Criteria
- [ ] Support for 100+ concurrent users
- [ ] Sub-200ms average API response times
- [ ] Complete security audit with no critical issues
- [ ] Tenant billing system fully operational
- [ ] Production deployment guide validated

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database Performance**: Implement query optimization and caching early
- **Scaling Issues**: Design with horizontal scaling in mind from start
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular security audits and penetration testing

### Project Risks
- **Feature Creep**: Stick to defined phases and success criteria
- **Quality Issues**: Implement testing and code review processes
- **Documentation Debt**: Document features as they're built, not afterwards

## Next Steps (Immediate Actions)

1. **Fix Server Stability** - Address Uvicorn restart issues and database timeouts
2. **Complete API Documentation** - Finish OpenAPI specifications with examples
3. **Implement Testing** - Set up automated testing framework
4. **Performance Audit** - Identify and fix database query bottlenecks
5. **Error Handling** - Standardize error responses across all endpoints

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- 1-2 Backend developers (Python/FastAPI expertise)
- 1 Frontend developer (JavaScript/Bootstrap)
- 1 DevOps engineer (deployment and monitoring)

### Infrastructure
- Replit deployment environment
- PostgreSQL database
- Monitoring and logging tools
- Testing and CI/CD pipeline
