# PyCommerce Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

PyCommerce is a scalable, multi-tenant ecommerce platform built with Python. It provides a modular architecture with a plugin system that allows for easy extension and customization. The platform is designed to support multiple tenants (ecommerce stores) on a single deployment, making it an ideal solution for SaaS ecommerce providers.

The platform combines modern technologies including FastAPI, Flask, SQLAlchemy, and PostgreSQL to deliver a high-performance, secure, and feature-rich ecommerce solution. It offers both headless API capabilities for custom frontends and built-in responsive templates for rapid deployment.

With its multi-tenant design, PyCommerce enables businesses to host multiple stores on a single infrastructure while maintaining complete data isolation and customization options. Advanced features include AI-powered product recommendations, a drag-and-drop page builder, comprehensive analytics, and secure payment processing with encrypted credential management.
