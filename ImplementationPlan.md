## Database Schema

### Multi-Tenant Approach
The database uses a schema-based multi-tenancy approach with the following considerations:
- Shared PostgreSQL instance with separate schema per tenant
- All tables include tenant_id for additional security
- Foreign key constraints respect tenant boundaries
- Indexes optimized for tenant-specific queries

## Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- API stateless design allows for easy horizontal scaling
- Database connection pooling for efficient resource usage
- Read replicas for high-traffic tenants
- Caching layer for frequently accessed data

### Vertical Scaling
- Resource allocation based on tenant tier
- Database partitioning for large tenants
- Memory and CPU allocation based on workload

## Security Measures

1. **Data Isolation**
   - Strict tenant data separation
   - Row-level security in PostgreSQL
   - Input validation and sanitization

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - JWT with short expiry
   - Role-based access control
   - API rate limiting
   - HTTPS enforcement

3. **Payment Security**
   - PCI compliance for payment processing
   - Tokenization of sensitive data
   - Regular security audits

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Performance Monitoring**
