# PyCommerce Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

PyCommerce is a scalable, multi-tenant ecommerce platform built with Python. It provides a modular architecture with a plugin system that allows for easy extension and customization. The platform is designed to support multiple tenants (ecommerce stores) on a single deployment, making it an ideal solution for SaaS ecommerce providers.

## Core Features

1. **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Isolate data and configurations for each tenant
2. **Plugin System**: Extend functionality with plugins for payments, shipping, etc.
3. **Product Management**: Comprehensive product catalog with categories and variants
4. **Cart & Checkout**: Flexible shopping cart and streamlined checkout process
5. **Order Management**: Complete order lifecycle management
6. **User Management**: Customer accounts and authentication
7. **API-First Design**: RESTful API for integration with frontend applications

- **Web Framework**: FastAPI for API, Flask for admin/demo
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **File Storage**: S3-compatible object storage

### Frontend Technologies
- **Framework**: React.js or Vue.js
- **CSS Framework**: Bootstrap
- **State Management**: Redux or Vuex

### Deployment Strategy
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS, GCP, or Azure
- **CDN**: Cloudflare or AWS CloudFront

## Database Schema

### Multi-Tenant Approach
The database uses a schema-based multi-tenancy approach with the following considerations:
- Shared PostgreSQL instance with separate schema per tenant
- All tables include tenant_id for additional security
- Foreign key constraints respect tenant boundaries
- Indexes optimized for tenant-specific queries

## Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- API stateless design allows for easy horizontal scaling
- Database connection pooling for efficient resource usage
- Read replicas for high-traffic tenants
- Caching layer for frequently accessed data

### Vertical Scaling
- Resource allocation based on tenant tier
- Database partitioning for large tenants
- Memory and CPU allocation based on workload

## Security Measures

1. **Data Isolation**
   - Strict tenant data separation
   - Row-level security in PostgreSQL
   - Input validation and sanitization

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - JWT with short expiry
   - Role-based access control
   - API rate limiting
   - HTTPS enforcement

3. **Payment Security**
   - PCI compliance for payment processing
   - Tokenization of sensitive data
   - Regular security audits

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Request timing metrics
   - Database query performance
   - API endpoint usage statistics
   - Error rate tracking

2. **Automated Maintenance**
   - Database backups
   - Log rotation
   - Index optimization
   - Security patches

## Migration Strategy

For existing ecommerce stores looking to migrate to PyCommerce:

1. **Data Migration**
   - Product catalog import tools
   - Customer data migration with privacy controls
   - Order history import
   - SEO preservation (URLs, metadata)

2. **Integration Services**
   - ERP/accounting system connectors
   - Shipping provider integration
   - CRM synchronization
   - Marketing tool connections
